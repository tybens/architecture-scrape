# Web scraping architecture, lighting, design, manufacturing companies / firms

My summer project and partnership with CA2L in Barcelona. 

## Setup

Install dependencies
```Bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use:

This command scrapes the (because `-a=at`) architizer site and (because `-w=0`) doesn't write it to a file, instead prints and (because `-ht=0`) doesn't use hunter.io to scrape for emails

```Bash
python main.py -a=at -w=0 -ht=0
```

For additional options
```Bash
python main.py -h
```
