# Web scraping architecture, lighting, design, manufacturing companies / firms

My summer project and partnership with CA2L in Barcelona. 

## Setup

Install dependencies
```Bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example usage:

This script scrapes the architizer site and (because `-w=0`) doesn't write it to a file, instead prints.

```Bash
python main.py -a=at -w=0
```
